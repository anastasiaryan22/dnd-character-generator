You cause the water level to all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20 foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrific or a gift of treausre. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measures in minutes requires a payments worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1000 gp per hour. A tast measures in days, up to 10 days, requires 10000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creatures ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a great gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creatures service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.')")

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an intelligence check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most commont triggers are opening the ojbect, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activate only under certain circumstances or according to a creatures physical characteristics, such as height or weight, or physical kind, for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers.

The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, cannot extend into the sphere. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nomagical longsword. A magic weapons properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
