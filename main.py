For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most commont triggers are opening the ojbect, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activate only under certain circumstances or according to a creatures physical characteristics, such as height or weight, or physical kind, for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers. You can also specify creatures that do not trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect.

Seen casually is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. Description is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone elses description, perhaps from a map. False destination is a place that does not exist.

Distance off target is 1d10 times 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east and so on around the points of the compass. If you were telporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar area. You and your group, or the target obect, wind up in a different area that is visually or thematically similar to the target area.
